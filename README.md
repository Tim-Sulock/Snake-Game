# Snake Game
This snake game coded in Java is my first personal project
The game has several methods including:
- ***A gameOver method that displays "Game Over" and the players score***
- ***A startGame method that starts the game once the code is ran***
- ***A playSound method that plays sound effects when they are called upon***
- and several more to carry out basic functions for the game
